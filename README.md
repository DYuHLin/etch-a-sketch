# etch-a-sketch
This will be a project displaying what I have learnt about JS and more specifically DOM manipulation.
This project will act as a drawing tool that will be able to draw, change colors change grid sizes,
adding a grid and clearing the grid. This project is going to require a bit of research.

2. I have a better understanding of for loops, the DOM and how to target styles
3. I know more about event listeners
